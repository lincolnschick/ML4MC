# Requirement 46

## Changes
This requirement involved first eliminating the ModelRunner class and moving its core functionality into the Model class. Then, I defined two new classes BCModel and RLModel, which inherit from Model and define code specific to each model type. Next, I made a few changes to the previous BC model classes and I defined the FightEnemiesModel class. Lastly, I updated controller.py to reflect these new changes.
