<h1>Requirement 48</h1>
This requirement involved improving training an agent for surviving in a hostile environment.
       
  
&nbsp;  
Successful completion of this task involved:
- Training a new model for combat
- The improved model: [improved_fight_enemies_model](https://github.com/lincolnschick/ML4MC/blob/main/docs/reports/requirement-48/improved_fight_enemies_model.pth)
- Providing the code for training and testing. The testing and training are both included here: [fh_combat.ipynb](https://github.com/lincolnschick/ML4MC/blob/main/docs/reports/requirement-48/fh_combat.ipynb)
- A written report comparing this and the previous models: [readme.md](https://github.com/lincolnschick/ML4MC/blob/main/docs/reports/requirement-48/readme.md)
- Videos demonstrating the best modelâ€™s performance: [avoid_mobs]()


<h2>Training and Testing</h2>
Similar to previous he survival environments, the agent was trained in a flat world, and the time was set to the middle of the night (18000 ticks). Mobs would appear frequently and approach the agent, creating hostile conditions.
