<h1>Requirement 29</h1>
This requirement involved training an agent for iron collection. 
       
  
&nbsp;  
Successful completion of this task involved:
- Training the AI agent using with the provided MineRL environment MineRLObtainIronPickaxe-v0 using reinforcement learning and/or behavioral cloning, and uploading a short report with the results, including the number of times the agent successfully mines iron with each model
- This may optionally incorporate scripting/enhanced behavior, as to not repeat the training completed in previous requirements. This actually was not required, and the task was accomplished by Behavioral Cloning alone, which was impressive.
- Uploading the code for the best model. This can be found at: [Iron_BC_Train.ipynb](https://github.com/lincolnschick/ML4MC/blob/main/docs/reports/requirement-29/Iron_BC_Train.ipynb) 
- Uploading a video of the agent running trained with the best model and successfully mining iron.
