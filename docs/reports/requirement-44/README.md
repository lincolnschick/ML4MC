Link to drive hosted successful_kill.mp4 -- video of the successful kill. Video of the training session is 9 minutes and so exceeds the file size limit of GitHub, which is why it is hosted externally. The kill is achieved in the first 15 seconds of the video.

The provided video demonstrates that the new model is capable of defeating enemies under desirable conditions. The video includes a zombie that capable of attacking the agent but has restricted movement because of a partial fence between the zombie and the agent. The agent can be defeated by the zombie if either the agent or the zombie moves around the fence or the agent stays near the fence for an extended period of time, which occurs frequently during training. In the provided video, the agent uses the partial fence to attack the zombie while not approaching close enough to the fence to take lethal damage, and successfully kills the zombie.
