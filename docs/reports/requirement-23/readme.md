<h1>Requirement 23</h1>
This requirement required training an agent for stone collection using Behavioral Cloning. 

<h2>Training</h2>
For training, we utilized and modified the MineRLObtainIronPickaxe-v0 environment and datasets. 
<h2>Testing</h2>
The model was tested using the custom environment we created in Requirement 26. The agent was initialized in a random seed, as to demonstrate the agent was not overfit to an
optimal environment. The results are as follows:

Episode #1 reward: 0.0   &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    episode length: 3000  
Episode #2 reward: 7.0   &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   episode length: 3000  
Episode #3 reward: 11.0  &emsp;&emsp; episode length: 3000  
Episode #4 reward: 0.0   &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; episode length: 3000  
Episode #5 reward: 3.0   &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    episode length: 3000  
Episode #6 reward: 0.0 &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; episode length: 1919  
Episode #7 reward: 12.0  &emsp;&emsp; episode length: 3000  
Episode #8 reward: 14.0  &emsp;&emsp; episode length: 3000  
Episode #9 reward: 0.0   &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; episode length: 1444  
Episode #10 reward: 21.0 &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  episode length: 3000
