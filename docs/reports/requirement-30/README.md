# Requirement 30
Successful completion of this requirement includes:
- Uploading the code for the shelter script
    - See [house.py](https://github.com/lincolnschick/ML4MC/blob/main/src/backend/scripts/house.py)
- Uploading a video demonstrating the script in action and end result
    - See [build_house_demo](https://github.com/lincolnschick/ML4MC/blob/main/docs/reports/requirement-30/build_house_demo.mov) and [house_image](https://github.com/lincolnschick/ML4MC/blob/main/docs/reports/requirement-30/house_image.png)
    - Note: it is not possible for the agent to place a door with MineRL (I suspect this is related to how objects are placed via commands), so this must be done by the human player
