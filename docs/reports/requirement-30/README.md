# Requirement 30
Successful completion of this requirement includes:
- Uploading the code for the shelter script
    - See [house.py]()
- Uploading a video demonstrating the script in action and end result
    - See [build_house_demo]() and [house_image]()
    - Note: it is not possible for the agent to place a door with MineRL (I suspect this is related to how objects are placed via commands), so this must be done by the human player
