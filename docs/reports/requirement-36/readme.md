<h1>Requirement 36</h1>
This requirement involved scripting and training an agent for diamond collection. Diamonds make up 0.016% of minerals in the game of Minecraft, so collecting one diamond in a run is an immense success.
       
  
&nbsp;  
Successful completion of this task involves:
- Training the AI agent using reinforcement learning and/or behavioral cloning, and uploading a short report with the results.
- Uploading the code for the best model
- Providing a script for diamond mining mimicking the strip mining approach that many players implement: [collect_diamonds.py](https://github.com/lincolnschick/ML4MC/blob/main/src/scripts/collect_diamonds.py)
- Uploading the results of running the script along with a video of the scripted agent obtaining diamonds (if it finds any): The script is above, and the videos are here: [finding_diamonds.mov](https://github.com/lincolnschick/ML4MC/blob/main/docs/reports/requirement-36/finding_diamonds.mov) [staircase.mov](https://github.com/lincolnschick/ML4MC/blob/main/docs/reports/requirement-36/staircase.mov)
- Write a report comparing the two approaches: [readme.md](https://github.com/lincolnschick/ML4MC/blob/main/docs/reports/requirement-36/staircase.mov)
